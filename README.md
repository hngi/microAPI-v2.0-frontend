# Micro API New Frontend

New fromtend repository for static files of the microAPI v2 project. Please read all instructions carefully as pull requests will be carefully accessed before being merged

### Folder Structure

The project consists of the main pages, the layout page and also an asset folder at the root directory. The layout contains the site header, footer and sidebars so please ensure your get the header and footer codes from there before proceeding.

In the assets folder, we have an images folder where all images should be sent to, there is a js folder containing js files for each page (the nav.js file is for the header/footer layout), there is also a fonts folder contains our custom fonts and most importantly, we have an SCSS folder and a CSS folder. All files in the SCSS folder compiles to one single minified css file which is located inside the CSS folder. The CSS folder and it's content SHOULD NEVER be touched or edited.
